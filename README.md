# to_do_list
<p>This is a tool I created to showcase my abilities in Python, Database and HTML. With it you can better manage a product and optimize time.</p>
You can create: 
"Projects",
"Stages": such as planning, being done and completed,  
"Tasks": activies to be carried out during a Stage which be canceled and ticked
off to kick it until the last stage.
